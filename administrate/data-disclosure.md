## Available properties of nodes and edges

By default, all properties of nodes and edges are available to the users of Linkurious. You can set some properties as unavailable. These properties will then no longer be accessible or searchable.

Open the Data administration dashboard, then scroll down to the **Node properties** section. All properties are marked as available in the following example.

Properties marked as not available will not show up in new or existing visualizations after we click on the **Apply** button.

We can configure edge properties the same way in the **Edge properties** section.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  Reindex data once the available properties are configured in order to remove them from search results.
</div>
