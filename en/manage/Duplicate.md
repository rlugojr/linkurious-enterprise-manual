# Duplicate

It is possible to duplicate a visualization. This feature might be useful when we want to try new things in our visualization and keep a record of the last version, this way the duplicate is used as a draft.


## From the Dashboard

It is possible to duplicate a saved visualization from the Dashboard as follows:

We then click on ```Duplicate``` and a copy of our visualization is displayed and directly accessible on the Dashboard:

## From the Workspace

It is also possible to duplicate a saved visualization from the Workspace via the Menu:

The duplicate is then accessible from the Dashboard menu.



Note that when duplicating from the Workspace, we are directly switching to the duplicate version to work on it.
