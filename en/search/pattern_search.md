# Pattern search

Most graph database support a query language that can be used to express pattern queries in the graph. Neo4j supports the ` Cypher` language, Titan and DataStax Enterprise Graph support the `Gremlin` language and AllegroGraph supports the `SPARQL` language.

In Linkurious, you can directly use these query language from the **"Find" > "Patterns"** menu. Once a query is previewed (using the "Preview" button), you can click the "Add all" button to add all matchign results to the current visualization.  

### With Neo4j: the Cypher query language

The `Cypher` query language is similar to `SQL` and can be learned from [Neo4j's online documentation](http://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/).

Here is an example Cypher query that is using the Crunchbase dataset (see [our online demo](http://demo.linkurio.us)):
```
MATCH (city:CITY)<-[hasCity:HAS_CITY]-(company:COMPANY)
WITH count(company) as score, city, company, hasCity
RETURN city, company, hasCity, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 25
```

This query will match all companies that are connected to a city in the database, count the number of companies in each city, sort the subgraphs by city and return the 25 cities that have the most companies, with their companies. Note the Cypher query has to contain a `RETURN` statement and that all information that need to be displayed in Linkurious must be included in the `RETURN` statement.
