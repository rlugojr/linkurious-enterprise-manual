# Alerts

In this chapter, we will learn how to work collaboratively on alerts. 
Administrators can configure alerts through the Administration panel. Users will then get a list of matches for each alert.

In fraud investigation or IT monitoring, alert matches happen when anomalous patterns appear in data. A team of analysts will investigate the matches to confirm the cases or dismiss the false positives. Graph visualization helps them to explore data in detail and to collect visual evidence of suspicious activity. They can report the results to escalate the matches by sharing the corresponding visualization.

Challenges rely on the quantity of alert matches processed by analysts: they have limited time and can select which matches to focus on. A score can be defined for an alert such as potential money lost, risk score, or date of the match.
