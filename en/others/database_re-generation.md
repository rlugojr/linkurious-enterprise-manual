# Database re-generation

In case you re-generate the graph database entirely, you can configure Linkurious to use a node or edge property as alterative identifiers, instead of using the identifiers generated by the database. Those identifiers are stored in visualizations to reference nodes and edges. With alternative identifiers, users won’t lose their visualizations the next time the database is re-generated. Notice that the properties used as identifier must be indexed by the database for efficient lookup.

See the keys ``alternativeNodeId`` and  ``alternativeEdgeId`` in **Getting Started > Configuration**.

Notice that if the store identifier has changed after re-generating the database, Linkurious won’t recognize it as the same database. You must assign the previous ``sourceKey`` explicitely to the configuration of the data source.
