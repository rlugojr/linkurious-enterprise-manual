### From the Quicksearch bar

We can start to explore the data and have a rapid look at a node and its relations through the Quick Search bar. The Quick Search bar is accessible directly from the Dashboard. 
Here we will look for the Company Instagram.

For example, if we want to look for the company Instagram, we simply type the name of any property associated with this node. Here, we type ```Instagram```, which is the name of the company. Few suggestions appear containing the word Instagram in one of their properties, we clik on the one we are interested in.
