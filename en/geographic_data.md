# Geographic data

Nodes must contain geographic coordinates as properties. Latitude and longitude data must be expressed in decimal degrees (e.g. "38.8897,-77.0089") as available in many geographic information systems (GIS).

The Administator should configure which property is the **latitude property**, and which property is the **longitude property** of the nodes of the datasource. Without configuration, Linkurious will try to use properties called "latitude" or "lat", and "longitude", "long" or "lng".

When geographic coordinates exist in a node of the visualization, you can switch to the **geo mode**.
