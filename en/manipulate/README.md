# Manipulate

In this chapter, we'll learn how to manipulate a graph and more exactly the different options Linkurious Enterprise provides to explore and work on a visualization. We will see how to expand or collapse nodes. Then we will learn how to select nodes and edges we are interested in, how to hide them, how to apply a layout to the graph and some useful shortcuts.
