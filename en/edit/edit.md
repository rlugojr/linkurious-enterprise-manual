## Edit properties and categories

Properties are key-value information stored in nodes and edges. It can be the name of a company for instance. Categories are special information to tag nodes and edges. Nodes can be of category Investor or Company, or both.

    In Neo4j databases, edges have one and only one category. It is not possible to modify it.

Click on the ```x``` next to the category to remove it.

To add a category, we click on ```+```. For example, we might be interested to add in our graph the activity of the investors.

Here we had the category Angel Investor to precise the field of work of the company Ron Conway.

We type the new category, here  ```Angel Investor```. We hit ```Save```.
