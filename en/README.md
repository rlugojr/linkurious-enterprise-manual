Linkurious Enterprise Manual
============================

This is the user manual of Linkurious Enterprise.

The first two chapters titled **Getting Started** and **Building Your First Graph Visualization** will teach you the basics of using Linkurious.

The following chapters are divided in themes. They go through the features of Linkurious and explain how to apply them to successfully visualize graphs. It works both as a manual and a primer on graph visualization.

Just like our software, this guide assumes no prior knowledge of graph visualization techniques. If you read it thoroughly, you will be able to find valuable connections and structural patterns in your data, to improve your graph database, and to communicate your findings efficiently.

Version of Linkurious Enterprise: v1.2.0 "Tragicomical Toucan".
