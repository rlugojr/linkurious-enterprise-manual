## Backup

### Linkurious

Follow these steps to perform a consistent backup:

1. Stop Linkurious.
2. Backup the folder `<linkurious-folder>/data`.
3. If you use MySQL or PostgreSQL instead of SQLite (default) as the internal data store of Linkurious, please backup these databases now.

Restart Linkurious once you have completed the backup of the Neo4j graph databases.

Please follow the [Neo4j documentation](http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/operations-backup.html) to perform hot backups of the graph database.

### Neo4j Community

2. Backup the folder `<neo4j-folder>/data` or any folder used to store the graph database.

You can restart Neo4j now.
