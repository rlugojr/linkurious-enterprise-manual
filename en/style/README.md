# Style

In this chapter, we'll learn how to adjust the size, color, captions and text of nodes or relationships. These techniques will help you make your visualizations more meaningful.

A default style may be defined by the Administrator of Linkurious Enterprise, see Chapter Getting Started > Styles. Users can change the styles after creating or opening a visualization. Notice that the styles set in new visualizations are automatically re-applied to newly created visualizations. Users can reset styles anytime.
