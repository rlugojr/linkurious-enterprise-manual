The geo mode switch is available on the left panel of the Workspace. 
You can enable and disable the geo mode at will to switch between the standard "network" view and the geographic view.

You can zoom in and out, drag nodes on the map to improve readability, select nodes and edges, etc. You can always reset the node coordinates to their original location via the actions menu:

Finally, you can publish an interactive widget from **Workspace menu > Publish** with the geographical layers. See the **Manage > Publish** chapter to know more.
