## Importing data

Linkurious relies on Neo4j to store the data. The data importation is thus not handled by our solution. If you want to import data to Neo4j, you have those solutions:

* there is a Gephi plugin that lets you export any file compatible with Gephi to Neo4j ([list of compatible formats](https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/))

* if you can handle a spreadsheet, you can [easily](http://blog.neo4j.org/2013/03/importing-data-into-neo4j-spreadsheet.html) import csv formated data

* for the more tech savvy there are even more option ([Batch importer](https://github.com/jexp/batch-import), [Talend connector](https://github.com/Zenika/talend-neo4j-connector))

* if you want to get help from professionals, we can get you in touch with great people.

* If you are still not sure about whether you can get your data in Linkurious contact us, we’ll be happy to answer if you contact us.

Finally, if you want to quickly try to use Linkurious Enterprise with dummy data, you can download a [Neo4j compatible dataset](http://neo4j.com/developer/guide-example-data/).
