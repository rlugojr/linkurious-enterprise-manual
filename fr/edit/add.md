## Create new nodes and edges

On the ```more options``` panel, we can choose to create either a node or an edge

We enter a value for the ```Categories```here Investor and hit add.

Here we entered the value ```Paris``` for the City property, the value ```France``` for the Country property and the value ```NewInvestor``` for the Name property.

We can see the node created ```NewInvestor``` added to our graph.


### Create an edge

We have to provide the following information :

* ```Type```: the type of relationship;
* ```Source```: the source of the relationship;
* ```Target```: the destination of the relationship.

Like for the nodes, we can add as many properties as we want to the edge. When we are done, we click on the ```Save``` button.

Here we entered the value ```Twitter``` for the Source, the value ```INVESTED_IN``` for the Type property and the value ```NewInvestor``` for the Target and finally ```2015``` for the ```funded_year``` property.


Finally, we can see in our graph our new node and our new edge:

It is also possible to create a new edge between two nodes by selecting those two nodes, right-clicking on the visualization background to display the context menu, then choose ```Create a new edge```. The source and target nodes will be filled.
