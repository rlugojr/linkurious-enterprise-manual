## Layouts

### Visualization controls

On the Workspace, various controls are available on the right-bottom of the screen:

- The ```shortcuts``` button: ![](Shortcuts.png), give access to a list of shortcuts to explore and interact with the graph.
- The ```Locate``` button ![](Locate.png) centers the graph on the screen.
- The ```Zoom In/Zoom Out``` button ![](ZoomIO.png) is to zoom in or zoom out on our graph.
- The ```Layout``` button give us various options to organize our graph.

A click on the layout button will apply the current layout, which is a fast force-directed layout by default. Two categories of layouts are available: force-directed, and hierarchical. They come with pre-defined flavors:

### Force-directed layout

Such layouts position nodes according to their connections: connected nodes are usually closed to each others, while disconnected nodes are usually pushed further.

**Best Mode:**
takes the longest time to compute new node positions but provides better results than the Fast Mode.

**Fast Mode (default):**
quickly finds new node positions but some overlapping nodes may exists.

**Random Mode:**
Node positions are randomized before computing new node positions.

### Hierarchical layout

Such layouts organize nodes in different layers automatically by aligning nodes of each layer either vertically or horizontally. The root nodes are automatically found.

**Top to bottom Mode:**
will position root nodes at the top of the screen.

**Left to Right Mode:**
will position root nodes at the left side of the screen.

**Bottom to top Mode:**
will position root nodes at the bottom of the screen.

**Right to left Mode:**
will position root nodes at the right side of the screen.
