# Graph
Mathematical object used to model the relationships between objects. To analyse networks, we use graph theory. Google, Facebook or Linkedin are among the companies that use graphs.
With the data deluge making peta-octets available, companies and science teams are striving today to make sense of big data, and to extract value from it. A significant amount of these data can be modeled as graphs, where nodes are entities and relationships are whatever connect them to each other. Properties may be attached to the nodes and relationships. Graphs are visualized using “node-link diagrams”, where circles represent the nodes, and lines represent the relationships.

# Graph database
Graph databases allow to store and to access up to several million nodes and their relationships. People are using it to build exciting social applications, recommendation engines, fraud detection systems, network & data center management solutions and much more. They offer an efficient solution to query ego-centered graphs (or “local views”), where one gets a node and the nodes around it.

# Edge
The relationships between the nodes of a graphes are called “edges” or “connections” or “links”.
Synonyms : link or connection or relationship

# Node
The different objects represented in a graph are called “nodes”.

# Property
A property is a value associated to a node or an edge. For example, if our graph contains a John Smith, we may have a node with the property ```name``` and the value ```John Smith```.

# Label
A label is a value associated to a node. It is a concept used to group nodes or edges into sets. For example if our graph contains many people like John Smith or Paul Durand, we may want to give these nodes a ```Person``` label.
