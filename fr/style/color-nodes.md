## Coloring the nodes according to a property

If all your nodes or edges have the same color, it is difficult to distinguish differences between them without looking at their individual properties. A great way to circumvent that issue is to choose to color the nodes according to a certain property.

For example, our nodes may have a ```country``` property that we would like to highlight, thus Linkurious Enterprise enables us to color the nodes according to a particular property, here ```country```.

This way, a French and a German start-up will have different colors. It will be easier to distinguish them visually.

In the picture below, we see the start-ups and investors Twitter is connected to. At first glance we have no idea where they are coming from.

First of all, let's open the design panel on the right corner of the screen and hit the ```Design``` tab. We can see all node properties. We click on the ```color``` button along the property ```country``` to color nodes by this property.

We see:
* the different values associated with the ```country``` property (CAN, GBR, JPN, RUS, USA);
* the number of occurences of each value there is (there are 20 nodes with the value ```USA```);
* which color is associated to which value (```USA``` is green)

Notice that the nodes that do not have a ```country``` property remain in grey.

To color the nodes according to another property, we first unset colors by clicking on the same ```color``` button:

Then, we can click on the ```color``` button of another property.
